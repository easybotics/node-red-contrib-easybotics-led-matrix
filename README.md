# node-red-contrib-led-matrix
set of node-red nodes binding to node-rpi-rgb-led-matrix library
Node Red binding of: https://github.com/keptan/node-rpi-rgb-led-matrix/

**In Order for the HZELLER back end to function, node-red must be running as root!**

**You can configure the node-red service on rpi to run as root, with the pi users home-dir**

**Otherwise you may be confused when the roots client doesn't have any of your nodes or flows** 

**You can also set this through the roots settings.json**
